# Title: Visual Nudge To Inverse Monetary Preferences

# Abstract
# In this study, I have examined the effect of visual nudges on consumer preferences. My design revolves around conducting a survey that asks an identical question that is accompanied by two different images. The study presents participants with two options: a $100 cash rebate or a free $150 Apple gift card with the purchase of an iPhone. The two distinct images, one of a cash sign and the other of an arrangement of Apple products appear with the question at random. The participant is asked for their preference on a 1-7 scale: 1 – high preference for the gift card, 7 – high preference for cash.
